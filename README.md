# freemarker-demo
Spring Boot sandbox for Freemarker Templates (.ftl/.ftlh)

### To Run:
I prefer Eclipse, so these instructions may need tweaking to work in IDEA, NetBeans, or any other IDE you may choose. You will need to install the Spring Tools 4 add-on from the Eclipse Marketplace and restart before attempting to run the application.

1) After cloning the repository to your machine, import the project into Eclipse:
    * Select File > Import > Gradle > Existing Gradle Project.
    * click Next.
    * select the root directory for the project repository.
    * Click Finish.
2. Right click the project name in the Package Explorer, and select "Run As" > "Spring Boot App"
3. In the Console, watch for the line ending with "Completed initialization in # ms".
4. After the app has started, open a web browser, and navigate to localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
